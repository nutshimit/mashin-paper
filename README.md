# Mashin Paper

Welcome to the Mashin Paper repository! This is where you'll find the comprehensive thesis on the cutting-edge Mashin Infrastructure as Code (IaC) engine, a revolutionary project developed by Nutshimit. As we gear up to unveil the full document, join us in exploring the transformative potential of Mashin and how it's poised to reshape the IaC landscape.

**Get ready for a game-changing approach to IaC! Stay tuned for the full thesis, coming soon.**

## Why Mashin?

In a world of ever-evolving cloud infrastructures, developers and operations teams demand efficiency, security, and simplicity. Mashin is the answer to these needs, bringing forth a fresh perspective on how we create and manage cloud infrastructure.

Mashin combines the power of Rust with the flexibility of JavaScript, creating a high-performance IaC engine that offers unparalleled security and ease of use. Its unique architecture and sandboxed environment ensure that the execution of infrastructure code is both efficient and secure, eliminating the need for third-party dependencies like Node.js or Webpack.

## A Glimpse into Mashin

The Mashin thesis delves into the engine's innovative concepts, design choices, and technical implementation details. Here's a sneak peek into some of the areas we'll be covering:

- Mashin's state-of-the-art architecture, which offers a seamless integration of Rust and TypeScript without any third-party dependencies
- The provider system, enabling the creation of custom providers that cater to diverse cloud infrastructure needs in Rust
- Security and sandboxed execution, ensuring that your infrastructure code is executed safely and securely, with a strong focus on preventing compromised dependencies
- Performance evaluation, showcasing Mashin's capabilities in handling real-world scenarios
